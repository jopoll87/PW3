  <h3>Bio</h3>
  <p>I live in South Weber Utah. I have 3 beautiful and fun children and a wonderful wife. I love to golf and to bike (both mountain and road). I was the Northridge High Golf Coach for 5 years. I coached both the Boys and the Girls teams during that
    time.</p>
  <p>This is my 11th year of teaching. My first 10 years were at Sunset Jr. High in
    Davis School District. This is also the Jr. High that I attended as a kid. This is my first year teaching at Rowland Hall. I started off as a History teacher and switched to Computer Science 5 years ago. This is my first year teaching exclusively
    Computer Science.</p>
